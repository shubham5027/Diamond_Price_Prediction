# Diamond Price Prediction using Machine Learning 💍💎

Predict the price of diamonds with machine learning! This project leverages data-driven insights to develop a model capable of accurately estimating the price of diamonds based on various features.


## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and more. These features serve as inputs for the machine learning model, aiming to capture the complexity of diamond pricing.

## 🚀 Machine Learning Model

The heart of the project lies in the machine learning model, which is trained to understand the relationships between different diamond features and their corresponding prices. The chosen model, whether it's a regression algorithm or an ensemble of models, is fine-tuned for optimal performance.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model is assessed using standard evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data and its predictive accuracy.

Explore the Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the machine learning code.

Run the code to train the model and make predictions on diamond prices.

🌟 Features

Feature Engineering: Explore the impact of different features on diamond prices.
Data Visualization: Visualize the relationships between features and prices using matplotlib or seaborn.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's performance through hyperparameter tuning.
Deployment (Optional): Deploy the model for real-time predictions using platforms like Flask, FastAPI, or cloud services.
